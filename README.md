# Hyperbeast

I used to play this when I was a kid and the speed of computers was measured in Khz.
It was called BEAST.EXE. As nobody seems to have copied it to the Internet, I made a simple clone as an exercise.

# Gameplay

Use arrow keys. Eliminate all monsters by squeezing them between blocks. A monster is only squashed, when it has its back against a block.

# Ideas

* Scores and timers
* Monsters side-step moved blocks
* Monsters wrap borders too
* Monsters are more intelligent in path-finding
* Monsters have random movements
* You can only squash monsters that are a level below you
* Dead and victory animations
* Diamonds (give extra capability)
* Rocks (can't be moved)
* Shooting
* Bombs
* Supermonsters (are bigger and/or can move blocks themselves)
